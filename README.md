# WasteLess App

Developed from idea submitted for NTU Impact Through Inspiration Ideathon, aiming to influence the community to tackle waste generation in Singapore.

App tracks a household's waste generation over time; data is gathered using weight sensors attached to an apartment's garbage chute and uploaded to a Firestore database through a Raspberry Pi
