# WasteLess App

Developed from idea submitted for NTU Impact Through Inspiration Ideathon, aiming to influence the community to tackle waste generation in Singapore.

App tracks a household's waste generation over time; data is gathered using weight sensors attached to an apartment's garbage chute and uploaded to a Firestore database through a Raspberry Pi.

Successfully deployed in Q1 2021 at The National University of Singapore (NUS)'s Tembusu Residential College.
