# WasteLess App

## Background
<p>
Developed from idea submitted for NTU Impact Through Inspiration Ideathon, aiming to influence the community to tackle waste generation in Singapore. We were spurred by Singaporeâ€™s 
domestic recycling rate decreasing from 22% in 2016 to 13% in 2020. We wanted to augment existing efforts by the government to help increase recycling rates in Singapore to assist in Singapore's
Zero Waste Initiative as the waste we produce contributes greatly to climate change too. 

Our project received funding from Southwest CDC and was successfully deployed in Q1 2021 at The National University of Singapore (NUS)'s Tembusu Residential College.

## Synopsis
<p>
The application tracks the amount of waste thrown away by the user. The information is then stored in the cloud, where the user can obtain that information from the mobile application along with other
information such as amount of waste generated relative to others in the same area.

The user accesses the chute by tapping a card that contains their unique RFID, unlocking the chute. The weight of their trash is measured by hardware inside the chute shaft and upon disposal of items,
the information is sent to the server and the data can be accessed by the user using the mobile application.
</p>

## Features
<p>
1. Leaderboard page that informs the user on his/her relative contribution to the amount of trash thrown in an area
2. History page to inform users on the amount of waste they generated and also the type of waste generated.
3. Filter function for both leaderboard and history page to enable users to obtain more accurate information on the type of waste generated to better aid decision making.
4. Settings page containing information for the user to access the chute manually.
