"Keep track of what is in your kitchen. Plan meals according to what you have, and what is expiring soon."
Cook just enough. Determine the amount to be cooked with the diners' appetites and eating habits in mind.
Use off-cuts or the equivalent. Off-cuts of meat and vegetable stems or roots can be used to make stocks. Citrus fruit rinds and zest can add flavour to other dishes.
"Share. Pack any excess food for your guests, friends or neighbours."
Check your kitchen before going grocery shopping. This prevents duplicate purchases.
Plan your purchases ahead. Make a shopping list and keep to it.
"Look past the imperfections. Odd-looking, bruised and blemished fruits and vegetables can be trimmed and used for cooking."
"""It was on offer."" Items on offer may be expiring soon. Buy only if you will consume it before expiry."
Store it correctly. Follow the storage instructions on the product's packaging. Some items must be kept in the fridge after opening.
"Check your fridge. The chiller operates best between 0°C and 4°C, and the freezer at -18°C and below."
"Store better. Chips, crackers and cereals last the longest when kept in airtight containers. Airtight bag clips are also an affordable option."
"Practise ""first to expire, first out."" Place products that are nearer to their expiry dates at the front of the fridge, freezer or cabinet. This reminds you to use them as soon as possible."
Use the freezer. Box up leftovers by the portion and freeze them so that they last longer and can be reheated easily for the next meal.
Keep garlic and onions fresh. Put garlic and onions in mesh bags (e.g. unused stockings) to keep them fresh.
Prevent bananas from ripening too fast. Wrap the stem of bananas with a plastic wrap to keep them for a longer time.
"Let celery last longer. Trim the leafy tops off celery, then wrap the trimmed celery tightly in aluminium foil and refrigerate it so it stays fresh for a longer time. Save the leaves for a tasty salad meal."
"Make full use of chocolate spread. Finished your chocolate spread? Pour some warm milk into a jar, cap it, and shake it up for a delicious cup of hot cocoa."
"Keep herbs fresh and handy. Mix chopped herbs with butter or olive oil and freeze them in an ice-cube tray. Use the frozen cubes to season popcorn, meat or steamed vegetables, or defrost to spread on toast!"
"Grow your own ingredients. Throw leftover ginger, garlic or scallions into a pot of soil. You will get a new pot of ingredients in 2 weeks!"
Give away excess food from your hamper. Consider sharing or donating excess non-perishables.
MAke chips rispy aGAin (MAGA). Chips and nuts that have turned soft can be made crispy again after baking for a few minutes.
Freeze your leftovers in small portions. Divide leftovers into small portions and pack them into airtight containers before freezing them.
"Go small. Provide smaller plates for guests to encourage smaller portions, reducing the amount left on plates."
Give with thought. Avoid highly perishable items. Choose food gifts that you know the recipient would enjoy.
Prepare just enough. â€¢ Make a shopping list and check it twice. Buy only what you need. Cater for 10-15% less than the number of expected guests.
"Order only what you can eat. Start with less food on the table and order more later, if you need to."
Share dishes. Offer a portion to your dining partner(s) before you start eating.
Do not rush to order more. It takes 15-20 minutes after eating to start feeling full.
Provide just enough. Downsize the portions of each dish if you are planning to serve a variety of dishes.
Consider what your colleagues are more likely to eat and buy just enough snacks for sharing in the office when you go holiday shopping!
"Set up an ""Eat These First"" area. Gather the soon-to-expire food and place them in that area. Encourage your colleagues to help themselves to those food!"
